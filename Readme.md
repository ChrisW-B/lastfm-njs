# LastFM-njs
A fully featured interface for Node and the Last.FM api

The full Last.FM API description can be found [here](http://www.last.fm/api)

You'll need an API key from [Create API Account](http://www.last.fm/api/account/create)

You can install using `npm install --save lastfm-njs`

Then you can set up like so, where username is a default username:
```js
var lastfm = require("lastfm-njs");
var config = require("./config");
var lfm = new lastfm({
    apiKey: config.key,
    apiSecret: config.secret,
    username: config.username
});
```

If a method requires writing to an account, then you also need password

```js
var lfm = new lastfm({
    apiKey: config.key,
    apiSecret: config.secret,
    username: config.username,
    password: config.password
});
```

After this, you can use any of the methods

#### All methods support ES6 promises if callback is not included
```js
lastfm.auth_getMobileSession(function(res) {
    if (res.success) {
        lastfm.album_addTags({
            artist: 'Oh Pep!',
            album: 'Living',
            tags: 'peppy,folk,music',
            callback(res) {
                printRes(res);
            }
        });
    }
    else{
        printError(res);
    }
});
```

is the same as
```js
lastfm.auth_getMobileSession().then(function(result) {
    lastfm.album_addTags({
        artist: 'Oh Pep!',
        album: 'Living',
        tags: 'peppy,folk,music',
    }).then(printRes).catch(printError);
}).catch(printError);

```
